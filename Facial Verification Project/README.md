## Overview

This project delves into building a face recognition application from scratch using Siamese Neural Networks, influenced by the principles presented in the research paper "Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition." Developed in *Python*, with *TensorFlow* as the primary deep learning framework, this project also integrates essential libraries like *OpenCV*, *NumPy* and *Matplotlib* to ensure a robust and efficient face recognition solution.
