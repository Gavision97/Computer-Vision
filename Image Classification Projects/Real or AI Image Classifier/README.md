# CIFAKE: Image Classification for Authenticity Verification (Using PyTorch)

## Motivation

In the relentless pursuit of knowledge and innovation, we embark on a compelling journey to unlock the potential of deep learning. Our mission is clear: to develop a robust model capable of distinguishing between authentic, real-world images and those crafted by artificial intelligence. This ambitious endeavor is driven by an unwavering curiosity, pushing the boundaries of computer vision and exploring its practical applications in content validation and image forensics.

The rapid advancement in the quality of AI-generated images has given rise to concerns regarding their authenticity and reliability. Our project takes center stage in addressing this critical issue, aiming to be a catalyst for trust in the digital realm. At its core lies CIFAKE, a meticulously curated dataset comprising 60,000 synthetic images and an equivalent number of genuine images sourced from CIFAR-10. CIFAKE serves as the linchpin for our exploration into the depths of computer vision and its capabilities.

## Project Overview

### Research Question
Can computer vision techniques be harnessed to reliably discern the origin of an image, distinguishing between those created by human hands and those crafted by artificial intelligence?

### Dataset: CIFAKE
CIFAKE is at the heart of our research, providing a diverse set of images for training and evaluation. With 60,000 synthetic images and an equal number of authentic images from CIFAR-10, it forms the foundation for our quest to redefine how we interact with, evaluate, and trust the images that permeate our digital world.

## Goals and Impact

- **Authenticity Verification:** Develop a model that can reliably differentiate between images created by humans and those generated by AI, contributing to the field of image forensics.

- **Trust in Digital Content:** Address concerns surrounding the authenticity of AI-generated images, promoting trust and transparency in the digital landscape.

- **Advancements in Computer Vision:** Push the boundaries of computer vision capabilities, paving the way for practical applications in content validation and beyond.

Join us on this exciting journey as we navigate the intersection of deep learning, computer vision, and the evolving landscape of digital authenticity. Together, we aspire to reshape the way we perceive and trust the images that define our digital experience.
